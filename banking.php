								<h4 class="dz-title">About BANKING Exams</h4>
								<div class="dz-post-text">
									<p>The Institute of Banking Personnel Selection is known by the initials IBPS. It is an independent recruitment organisation created by the Indian government to support the hiring of recent graduates and their placement in Indian public-sector banks. The IBPS was established in 1984 and offers enterprises standardised systems for evaluation and result processing. The RBI, the Indian Finance Ministry, and NIBM are the bodies that oversee the IBPS. Additionally, representatives from numerous publicly traded banks and insurance businesses are also given a voice in the decision-making process.</p>
									<p>You should be aware that this exam is not as difficult as it is portrayed to be. If you prepare for all the topics, or at least the majority of them, practise the last two years' question sets, and enter the exam with a calm demeanour, I am confident that you will pass. Nothing can stop you from passing the exam and receiving high marks if you receive the right coaching and put in the necessary amount of practise.</p>
									
									
									<h4 class="m-b30">The IBPS Exam Syllabus Is As Follows,</h4>
									
									<p>IBPS PO Preparation Plans should be created with consideration of the candidate's entire development in mind. IBPS PO is a difficult exam that necessitates a high level of knowledge and abilities in order to pass with the highest possible score. The majority of candidates concentrate just on expanding their knowledge and completing the syllabus.</p>
											<h5 class="m-b30"> IBPS PO Exam</h5>
									<p>There are three phases to the IBPS PO exam: the preliminary, the main, and the interview.
The total score for the preliminary exam is 100 (reasoning = 35, quantitative = 35, and English = 30).
In the mains, there were 200 total marks (50 in reasoning, 50 in math, 40 in English, 40 in general awareness, and 20 in computers).
</p>
									<h5 class="m-b30">IBPS Clerk Exam</h5>
									<p>There are three stages to the IBPS Clerk exam: the preliminary, the mains, and the interview.
The total score for the preliminary exam is 100 (reasoning = 35, quantitative = 35, and English = 30).
Total marks for the mains are 200 (reasoning, quantitative, English, general awareness, and computer each receive 40 points).
</p>
									
									<p>Therefore, there is a slight variance in the mains marking scheme for IBPS PO & Clerk.
The preliminary exam is intended for screening purposes, so the results won't be counted.
The results of your major examination and interview will determine your merit list. </p>
